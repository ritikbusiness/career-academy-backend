You are building the complete backend for a Learning Management System called Desired Career Academy.
Use Node.js (Express) with PostgreSQL (or MongoDB if preferred), and write modular clean APIs. Use MVC architecture and ensure all routes are RESTful.

🧠 AI & Gamification Features (Next-Gen Add-ons)

🔥 1. AI-Powered Answer Review
Use DeepSeek or GPT API (mocked for now) to auto-score answers:
Analyze grammar, clarity, and correctness


Model:


AIScore {
  id,
  answerId,
  aiScore,
  summaryComment
}

Attach score next to user-submitted answers (visible only to them)



📊 2. Skill Tagging & Analytics
Track XP earned per skill (e.g., DevOps, Python, etc.)
Add skillTag to questions


Model:


SkillProgress {
  userId,
  skillTag,
  totalXP
}

Dashboard:


Pie chart of skill XP


Weekly skill growth



🎯 3. Missions & Daily Challenges
Admins create missions like:


"Answer 2 questions"


"Earn 15 XP in DevOps"


Students complete and claim XP


Models:


Mission {
  id, title, description, xpReward
}
MissionProgress {
  userId, missionId, isCompleted
}


📈 4. Answer Quality Tracker
Track vote history for answers:
Use for leaderboard, mentor selection


Route: /api/quality/:userId


Model:


AnswerFeedback {
  id, answerId, userId, voteType: 'up' | 'down'
}


🌐 5. Live Peer Collaboration
Allow users to join real-time question rooms


Basic API: /api/questions/:id/join


Track active participants (mock WebSocket)



🔔 6. Notification System

Example unlock rules:


1000+ XP + 20 answers given


Check logic at route level



🤖 8. AI Mentor Bot
After 24 hours with no human answer, auto-post:


"AI Suggested Answer" using DeepSeek/GPT


Store answer with flag isAI: true

🧱 Stack & Practices
Node.js + Express


PostgreSQL preferred, but MongoDB is okay


Modular routes (/api/auth, /api/answers, etc.)


Use Prisma or Sequelize (for SQL) or Mongoose (for Mongo)


Environment-ready (.env support)


Ensure structure is easy to extend



✨ Final Note: Build clean API endpoints. You don’t need frontend—just full backend logic with models, routes, and dummy data where necessary.
This is for a production-grade LMS project called Desired Career Academy.

💥 Let’s Go, Replit AI 💥
"Now build it modular, clean, and scalable as if it's going to be used by 100,000 students worldwide."

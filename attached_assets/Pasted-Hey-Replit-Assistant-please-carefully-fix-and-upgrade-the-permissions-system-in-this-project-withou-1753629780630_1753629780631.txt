Hey Replit Assistant, please carefully fix and upgrade the permissions system in this project without breaking or disturbing any existing user login, registration, or student functionality.

Here’s what needs to be done:

🚨 0. Recover Admin Account & Features:
- We had already created an admin user previously. Please make sure that account is still recognized as admin.
- Recover any admin-specific dashboard or access features that were deleted or broken.
- If needed, check the database for an existing user with `role: "admin"` and enable their admin panel access again.

🛠️ 1. Ensure Admin Role Works:
- Check if the logged-in user has `role: "admin"` before showing admin-only features.
- Middleware or route guards should protect all `/admin/*` routes.
- Admin should never lose access once marked as an admin.

📊 2. Restore Admin Dashboard:
- Create or restore a clean dashboard for admin at `/admin/dashboard`.
- Admin should see exclusive tools like: instructor approval, user management, and system settings.
- Frontend must conditionally show the admin dashboard only to users with `role === "admin"`.

👨‍🏫 3. Instructor Approval System (New Feature):
- Instructors should sign up and be marked with `role: "instructor"` and `status: "pending"` by default.
- Admin dashboard must include a section to:
  - View all pending instructors
  - Approve or reject them
  - Change their status to `approved`
- Only instructors with status `approved` should be allowed to access instructor routes and features.

🔐 4. Instructor Signup Security:
- Instructor signup must be protected with an **invite link or unique token** (created only by admin).
- Anyone trying to sign up as instructor without a valid invite should be shown an error or redirected.
- Admin must have a way to generate these instructor invite links/tokens.

🛡️ 5. Secure Route Access:
- All `/admin/*` routes must be protected so only admin users can access them.
- All instructor-only routes must check:
  - `role === "instructor"`
  - AND `status === "approved"`

✅ 6. Don’t Break Existing Functionality:
- Please DO NOT disturb any part of the current:
  - Student signup/login
  - Course access
  - Normal user dashboard
- Just enhance and recover the admin and instructor roles cleanly.

Thank you! Please handle all this carefully.
